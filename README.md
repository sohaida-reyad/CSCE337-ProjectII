# CSCE337-ProjectII

Our Static Timing Analyzer is an application that accepts a gate-level netlist (GLN), 
a library file (liberty), net capacitance file, and timing constraints file, then it 
parses those files into internal data structures that will be integrated to perform 
analysis. The gate-level netlist is parsed into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from 
which the different timing paths of the given logic will be deduced. Each path is 
then analyzed to obtained the pathâ€™s arrival time, required time, and slack, which 
all will be saved in a report file.

This project does the following:

1- Read the verilog gate level netlist file, net capacitance file, and timing constraints file. 
2- Read and Parse Liberty file
3- Convert gate level netlist to DAG
4- Identify all 4 types of timing paths. 
5- Perform STA by calculating arrival time and required times and calculating the slacks
6- Generate timing reports
